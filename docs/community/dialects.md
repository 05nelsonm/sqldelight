# Community Dialects

SqlDelight provides a dialect api, so it is possible to build and use other dialects too.
If you want to write custom dialects, check out the [introduction about writing custom dialects](../custom/dialects).

This is an (alphabetic) list of dialects developed by the community.
Feel free to extend this list if you miss some dialects.
